        "## Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "To develop a reliable and interpretable decision-support system for neonatal health monitoring. The system predicts infant risk levels (Healthy vs. At-Risk) by analyzing a multidimensional dataset of maternal, prenatal, and postnatal clinical indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This project adopts a comparative modeling approach, evaluating performance across a spectrum of complexity—ranging from transparent statistical baselines to advanced deep learning architectures.\n",

        "## **Methodology & Comparative Models**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Primary Statistical Baseline — Logistic Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Implementation**: Establishing a linear probabilistic benchmark.\n",
        "- **Rationale (Intrinsic Interpretability)**: Logistic Regression is interpretable by design, providing a \"transparent box\" for clinical decision-making.\n",
        "  - **Mathematical Transparency**: Every feature is assigned a clear mathematical weight (Coefficient). A high positive coefficient signifies a Risk Factor, while a negative coefficient signifies a Protective Factor.\n",
        "  - **Exact Impact vs. Approximation**: Unlike non-linear models where feature importance must be estimated via external proxies, Logistic Regression provides the exact mathematical influence of each variable. It does not require an external algorithm to be understood, making it the perfect \"ground truth\" to validate if SHAP and LIME accurately reflect clinical reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Non-Linear Baseline — Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Implementation**: Finding an optimal hyperplane to separate classes in high-dimensional space.\n",
        "- **Rationale**: Selected due to its strong performance in previous neonatal risk research. It serves as a benchmark to see if a non-linear boundary improves prediction over simple regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Advanced Boosting — XGBoost\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Implementation**: Utilizing Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT).\n",
        "- **Rationale**: Captures higher-order feature interactions (e.g., the compounded risk of low birth weight combined with low oxygen levels) that linear models might miss.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Data Balancing — SMOTE\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Implementation**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique.\n",
        "- **Rationale**: Corrects the natural class imbalance (few high-risk infants vs. many healthy infants). By generating realistic synthetic samples, it improves fairness and ensures the model is sensitive to the \"At-Risk\" minority.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Deep Learning Innovation — ChurnNet Adaptation\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Architecture**: 1D-CNN layers integrated with Attention Mechanisms.\n",
        "- **Rationale**: Designed to learn complex non-linear patterns in medical tabular data. The attention mechanism allows the model to \"focus\" on specific vital signs that are most critical for a given infant's health status.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Explainability — XAI (SHAP + LIME)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Implementation**: Using SHAP for global importance and LIME for instance-level explanations.\n",
        "- **Rationale**: Improves interpretability, transparency, and clinical trust. These tools allow us to explain the \"Black Box\" decisions of XGBoost and ChurnNet, ensuring that the model's logic aligns with established medical knowledge."

        "Critical Threshold: Lower Apgar scores (typically < 7) are strongly associated with the \"At Risk\" group.\n",
        "\n",
        "Healthy Baseline: Infants in the \"Healthy\" category consistently show high scores (8–10), validating this score as a crucial early predictor.\n",

        "Observation: High scores (8–10) are almost exclusively associated with the Healthy group. Lower scores (typically < 7) are heavily concentrated in the At Risk group, confirming its diagnostic value.\n",
        "\n",
        "####**2. Oxygen Saturation** (oxygen_saturation)\n",
        "Skewed Distribution: The \"Healthy\" group shows a tight distribution around high values (95-100%).\n",
        "\n",
        "Risk Indicator: The \"At Risk\" group exhibits a left-skewed distribution, with a significantly higher frequency of lower saturation levels, indicating respiratory distress or other complications.\n",

        "####**3. Birth Weight & Current Weight** (birth_weight_kg, weight_kg)\n",
        "Extremes Matter: While there is overlap in the average weight range, the \"At Risk\" category tends to capture the extremes—both very low birth weights (potential prematurity) and potentially very high weights, which can carry their own risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "####**4. Vital Signs** (heart_rate_bpm, respiratory_rate_bpm)\n",
        "Shifted Centers: Although the distributions overlap, the \"At Risk\" group often shows a shifted center of gravity or wider variance (\"fatter tails\"). This suggests that while a single reading might be normal, at-risk infants fluctuate more often into abnormal ranges (tachycardia/bradycardia or tachypnea).\n",
        "\n",
        "####**5. Temporal Trends** (age_days)\n",

        "####**2. Infant Age** (age_days)\n",

        "Warning Sign: There is a negative correlation (-0.14), indicating that higher heart rates (tachycardia) are associated with higher risk levels.\n",

        "\n",
        "### At Risk Class (1):\n",
        "- **Precision (0.76)**: When the model predicts a risk, it is correct 76% of the time.\n",
        "- **Recall (0.55)**: This is the most critical area for improvement. The model only successfully identified 55% of the actual \"At Risk\" infants, leaving 45% undetected (False Negatives).\n",

        "\n",
        "- **True Positives (44)**: Successfully identified high-risk cases.\n",
        "- **False Negatives (36)**: These represent infants who are clinically \"At Risk\" but were incorrectly classified as \"Healthy.\" In a neonatal environment, minimizing these \"misses\" is a top priority to ensure timely intervention.\n",

        "The baseline model demonstrates a strong foundational understanding of the dataset but tends to favor the majority class (Healthy). The high accuracy is largely driven by the disproportionate number of healthy samples ($N=520$ vs $N=80$).\n",

        "**Conclusion**: To improve the detection rate (Recall) for infants at risk, we must address the class imbalance in the next phase using techniques like **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** or by exploring more complex non-linear models like **SVM** and **XGBoost**."

        "\n",
        "#### **Key Metrics Analysis:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **High Sensitivity (Recall for \"At Risk\"): 93%**\n",
        "    * **What it means:** Out of all the infants who were truly \"At Risk\" (Class 0), the model successfully identified **93%** of them.\n",
        "    * **Clinical Relevance:** In healthcare, **Recall is the most critical metric**. Missing a sick infant (False Negative) can have severe consequences. A score of 93% indicates the model is very safe and reliable as a screening tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Moderate Precision (\"At Risk\"): 76%**\n",
        "    * **What it means:** When the model predicted an infant was \"At Risk\", it was correct **76%** of the time. The remaining 24% were \"False Alarms\" (healthy babies flagged as sick).\n",
        "    * **Clinical Relevance:** While we aim to increase this, a lower precision is acceptable in medicine if it guarantees high recall. It is better to unnecessarily check a healthy baby than to send a sick baby home.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Overall Accuracy: 95%**\n",
        "    * The model correctly classified the vast majority of cases. The use of `class_weight='balanced'` successfully prevented the model from being biased towards the majority \"Healthy\" class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Conclusion & Next Steps:**\n",
        "The SVM has set a high bar with excellent Recall. In the next step (**XGBoost**), we will attempt to maintain this high Recall while trying to improve the Precision (reducing false alarms) and understanding which features drive these decisions."

        "\n",
        "By applying XAI techniques (SHAP & LIME), we uncovered the specific medical features that drive the model's risk predictions. The analysis reveals that the model did not just memorize data, but actually learned **medically valid patterns**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the critical features identified by the model:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Jaundice Level (`jaundice_level_mg_dl`)\n",
        "* **Model Finding:** This was identified as the **top risk factor** by the CNN model for high-risk infants. Specifically, levels around **4.6 mg/dL** in older infants (20+ days) were strongly penalized.\n",
        "* **Clinical Explanation:** While jaundice is common in newborns, *prolonged jaundice* (persisting beyond 2 weeks) can indicate underlying pathology (such as liver disease or metabolic disorders). The model correctly \"learned\" that the danger is not just the number, but the number *relative to the age*.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Stool Count (`stool_count`)\n",
        "* **Model Finding:** A count of **0 (zero)** significantly increased the predicted risk probability.\n",
        "* **Clinical Explanation:** Stool frequency is a key indicator of adequate feeding and digestive health in newborns. A lack of bowel movements can signal dehydration, obstruction, or insufficient intake. The model identified \"Zero Stool\" as a critical red flag.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Birth Weight (`birth_weight_kg`)\n",
        "* **Model Finding:** XGBoost identified this as a primary global predictor (SHAP). Lower values consistently pushed the prediction towards \"Risk\".\n",
        "* **Clinical Explanation:** Low birth weight (LBW) is a well-known foundational risk factor associated with immature immune systems and higher susceptibility to infections and complications.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. The \"Context\" Factor: Age (`age_days`)\n",
        "* **Model Finding:** This feature acted as a **modifier**. The model treated symptoms differently depending on the age.\n",
        "* **Clinical Explanation:** The model demonstrated temporal reasoning. It understood that a symptom considered \"normal\" at Day 2 might be \"critical\" at Day 20. This ability to understand context is likely why the Deep Learning model (CNN) outperformed the classical model.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "**Conclusion:** The variables prioritized by the AI align with established pediatric guidelines, validating the model's potential as a reliable Decision Support System (DSS) for medical staff."

        "###  3. Clinical Implications & XAI\n",
        "Using **SHAP** and **LIME**, we cracked the \"Black Box\" to validate the medical logic:\n",
        "* **The \"Context\" Discovery:** The CNN model demonstrated the ability to understand context. For example, it identified that *Jaundice* (level > 4.5) is a high-risk factor specifically when combined with *older infant age* (>15 days), aligning with pediatric pathology logic.\n",
        "* **Specific Risk Factors:** The model successfully flagged **Low Stool Count** and **Low Birth Weight** as critical indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "###  4. Final Recommendation\n",
        "We recommend deploying **ChurnNet (CNN)** as a Decision Support System (DSS) for the medical team. It offers the highest reliability, minimizes \"alert fatigue\" (fewer false alarms), and provides interpretable reasoning for each diagnosis."
