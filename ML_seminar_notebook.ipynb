Bilirubin is a substance that causes newborn jaundice, which is very common in the first days of life. High bilirubin levels can indicate a medical risk if they are not monitored or treated properly. Because of this, jaundice level is an important clinical indicator and it makes sense that the model treats it as a major factor in predicting risk.\n",

        "\n",
        "To provide an additional explainability method, we applied LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to the same XGBoost model used in our first experiment.\n",
        "While SHAP explains the model globally, LIME focuses on explaining a single prediction by approximating the model’s behavior in a small neighborhood around a chosen sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the selected infant record, LIME produced a clear visualization showing which features contributed toward the “Healthy” prediction and which features pushed the model toward “At Risk”. In this specific example, the model predicted Healthy with a probability of 1.00.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most influential factors that supported the “Healthy” classification were:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. High oxygen_saturation (98%)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Low jaundice_level_mg_dl (1.40)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Stable heart_rate_bpm\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normal apgar_score\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Moderate stool_count\n",
        "\n",
        "Factors that slightly pushed toward “At Risk”, but with low influence, included:\n",
        "\n",
        "Use of mixed feeding type\n",
        "\n",
        "Low or zero immunizations_done\n",
        "\n",
        "Certain birth-related measurements (e.g., head circumference or low birth_weight)\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the LIME explanation confirms the importance of jaundice level, oxygen saturation, and heart rate, which is consistent with the SHAP global results from Experiment 1.\n",
        "Using both SHAP and LIME together improves the explainability of the model by offering both global and local perspectives on infant risk assessment."
